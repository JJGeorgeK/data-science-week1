  TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================
  
  [ yes] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
  ----------------------
  
  1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?
  
  [x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
[ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?
  
  [x] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
[ ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
[x] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
[x] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
[ ] Other: ___________
[ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:
  
  Variable name: species

Example values BEFORE:
Adelie 
adelie
Adelie

What they would become AFTER:
adelie
adelie
adelie

  4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:
  
  Why not? (Check all that apply)
[ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[yes] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [x] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [ ] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: date_egg
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 16/11/2007
   - 01/12/2009
   - 23/11/2008
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 2007-11-16
   - 2009-12-01
   - 2008-11-23


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   (e.g., "01/12/2023 is DD/MM/YYYY not MM/DD/YYYY")
   assuming that the date_egg variable is recorded using DD/MM/YY format
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   the day and month values could be switched if interpreted wrong, this would affect calculations for breding times.
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   i could check the data set documentation, review the date ranges to confirm
   they match expected penguin breeding seasons


5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: delta_15n | Percent missing: ~4%
   Variable: delta_13c | Percent missing: ~4%
   Variable: sex | Percent missing: <1%


3. Missingness types checklist


   [ ] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [x] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have? 
If missingness is MAR, deletion may systematically remove certain groups and distort estimates, so targeted dropping or modelling/imputation may be better.

TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
    I am assuming that duplicate rows represent accidental repeated records rather than true biological observations. 
    Removing them assumes each penguin measurement should only appear once in the dataset.
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [ ] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [x] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - Skip to Part B


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: body_mass_g
   
   Minimum value: 2700  | Is this biologically possible? [x] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure
   Maximum value: 6300  | Is this biologically possible? [x] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [ ] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [ ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ ] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [x] Other: Species-specific plausibility issue



PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related (e.g., body length and body mass,
   sex and reproductive status, species and location):

   Variable 1: flipper_length_mm
   Variable 2: body_mass_g
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [x] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ ] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   penguins with higher body mass points far from this trend coud indicate measurement error.


6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [ ] Convert one variable to NA (which one? _________)
   [x] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
   Outliers are not automatically errors—biological variation exists. For this dataset, the basic ranges
   look plausible. However, a small number of records are species- or relationship-unusual. Best practice is to flag these records for checking.
