WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Joel]
Date: [30-01-26]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: 
treatment has inconsistent capital letters

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 1]

Which variable(s) affected: 
treatment

Why this is important to fix: 
inconsistent labels may cause errors

What I plan to do: 
standardize treatment using strings


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: some body_mass_mg are negative, which is biologically impossible.

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 7]

Which variable(s) affected: 
body_mass_mg

Why this is important to fix: 
negative mass effects data

What I plan to do: 
identify negative values and convert them to NA


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------



QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. How to decide when missing data is random or systematic

2. How to determine whether extreme biological values represent real variation or measurement errors.
