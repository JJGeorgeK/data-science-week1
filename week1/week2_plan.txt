WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Joel]
Date: [30-01-26]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: Are there inconsistent spellings/capitalisation/whitespace in categorical variables 
like species, island, sex, or clutch_completion that would create duplicate levels?

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 1]

Which variable(s) affected: [species, island, sex, or clutch_completion]

Why this is important to fix: [Inconsistent category labels would cause R to treat identical biological groups as separate categories.
This would produce incorrect species counts, inaccurate summary statistics, and unreliable comparisons between groups]

What I plan to do: [I will standardise text variables by converting them to consistent lowercase format, 
removing extra whitespace, and correcting any inconsistent spellings using string cleaning functions such as str_to_lower(), str_trim(), and str_replace()]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [The date_egg variable is stored as character text rather than a proper date format, which could cause incorrect date interpretation during analysis.]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 2]

Which variable(s) affected: [date_egg]

Why this is important to fix: [Incorrect date formatting can lead to errors when calculating time ranges, summarising breeding seasons, or analysing temporal trends in penguin reproduction.]

What I plan to do: [I will convert the date_egg variable into a standard date format using the lubridate dmy() function and check for parsing errors or inconsistent date entries.]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- Missing values in variables such as delta_15n, delta_13c, sex, and some body measurements, which may affect summary calculations.
- A small number of biologically unusual body mass values that may represent natural variation or measurement error.
- Potential cross-variable inconsistencies between body mass and flipper length that require further investigation.



QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. How to decide when missing data should be removed versus handled using statistical methods such as imputation.

2. How to determine whether extreme biological values represent real variation or measurement errors.

3. Whether it is better to permanently clean datasets or to create cleaned copies for different analyses.
